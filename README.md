The European Forest Disturbance Atlas (EFDA) is Landsat-based approach for mapping annual forest disturbances across continental Europe since 1985 🌳🌲🛰️🗺️

This is a repository for the work related to forest disturbance mapping. This work is part of the [ForestPaths](https://forestpaths.eu/) project (Co-designing Holistic Forest-based Policy Pathways for Climate Change Mitigation, ID No 101056755).

The European Forest Disturbance Atlas data is freely accessible under https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13333034 (Viana-Soto and Senf, 2024).
Summary layers are accessible through Google Earth Engine in ee.Assets.latest_disturbance_v211, ee.Assets.number_disturbances_v211, ee.Assets.disturbance_agent_v211. 
The maps can be also explored online: https://albaviana.users.earthengine.app/view/european-forest-disturbance-map. 
Code used for processing the Landsat data using FORCE is available in https://github.com/davidfrantz/force.
